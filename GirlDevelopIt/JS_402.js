// JS 402 notes

// Notes available at http://www.teaching-materials.org/backbone/#/10

// Framework of backbone.js (partially MVC):

// Model: containing the interactive data as well as a large part of the logic surrounding it
// View: holds everything that makes up what the data will look like
// Collection: A collection is an ordered set of models, apparently
// Router: used for routing your applications URL's when using hash tags(#) - see this webpage for more info. Appears to be similar to what sinatra does! http://backbonetutorials.com/what-is-a-router/

// Backbone contains defaults for the model and view that you can instantiate new versions of.

// You can use the .set() and .get() attributes for backbone models to update and retrieve these properties.

// Feedback for GDI: I have found it extroadinary helpful go to through a simple tutorial of the topic being given BEFORE coming into class. Because the workshops move at a fairly quick pace and I do not consider myself a fast learner, it gives me a good foundation of the basics so I can spend the most energy invested into the part where we put it all together. I would recommend recommending people to consider doing this just to build up their understanding of what the terms are going to be before they even walk into the room. (Revise before sending)
